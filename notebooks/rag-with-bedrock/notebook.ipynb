Fine-tuning, explored in other workshops, deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...). \n\nIn contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles. \n\nIn this notebook we explain how to utilize the RAG (retrieval-agumented generation) pattern originating from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) paper published by Lewis et al in 2021. It is particularily useful for Question Answering by finding and leveraging the most useful excerpts of documents out of a larger document corpus providing answers to the user questions.\n\n#### Prepare documents\n![Embeddings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saurshan/spaces-notebooks/master/notebooks/rag-with-bedrock/assets/RAG_pipeline_S2_Bedrock.png)\n\nBefore being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n- Load the documents\n- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n#### Ask question\n![Question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saurshan/spaces-notebooks/master/notebooks/rag-with-bedrock/assets/RAG_runtime_S2_Bedrock.png)\n\nWhen the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n- Create an embedding of the input question\n- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Usecase\n#### Dataset\nIn this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on."},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Implementation\nIn order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n\n- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude available through Amazon Bedrock\n\n  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n\n  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n\n- **Document Loader**: \n    - PDF Loader available through LangChain for PDFs\n\n  These are loaders that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n\n- **Vector Store**: SingleStoreDB available through LangChain\n  In this notebook we are using SingleStoreDB to store both the embeddings and the documents.\n\nThen begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Anthropic Claude to demonstrate the use case.\n\nNote: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock.
