Fine-tuning, explored in other workshops, deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...). \n","\n","In contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles. \n","\n","In this notebook we explain how to utilize the RAG (retrieval-agumented generation) pattern originating from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) paper published by Lewis et al in 2021.
